TailwindCSS project

In this project I demonstarte my understanding and application of TailwindCSS properties within an HTML file.

First I was confused by the initial installation process of tailwind. 
I would get confused between what the TailwindCSS documentation stated versus what was given to us. For example, on TailwindCSS, it says that if you wanted to set the text color of an element to white, to use: text-white. In the LMS though, they gave us the example of: dark:text-white. I didn't understand how its both dark and also white. Then I realised that is included for when the user's screen is switched to dark mode, the text will appeaar white.

ARIA attributes are challenging. I couldn't understand how to target my elements to only be applied upon specific ARIA commands, such as focus.

When trying to add a hover effect to my button so that it would be rounded when hovered upon, it worked for large screen devices. But in the devtools, it wouldn't apply when hovered, only when selected. I couldn't understand why that is the case.

I struggled with setting the max-width dimensions on the input and button. When I viewed it on the iphone SE screen, the size matched the reference picture, whereas on the iPad mini and desktop, the h1 element would be too small. It took me a while to identify if the issue was related to the size of the h1, the padding around it, or the width of the button and input field.

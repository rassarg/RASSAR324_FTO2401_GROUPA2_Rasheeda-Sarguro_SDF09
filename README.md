TailwindCSS project

I would get confused between what the TailwindCSS documentation stated versus what was given to us. For example, on TailwindCSS, it says that if you wanted to set the text color of an element to white, to use: text-white. In the LMS though, they gave us the example of: dark:text-white. I didn't understand how its both dark and also white. Then I realised that is included for when the user's screen is switched to dark mode, the text will appeaar white.

ARIA attributes are challenging. I couldn't understand how to target my elements to only be applied upon specific ARIA commands, such as focus.

When trying to add a hover effect to my button so that it would be rounded when hovered upon, it worked for large screen devices. But in the devtools, it wouldn't apply when hovered, only when selected. I couldn't understand why that is the case.
